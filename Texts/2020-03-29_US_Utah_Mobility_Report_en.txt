COVID-19 Community Mobility Report

Utah  March 29, 2020

Mobility changes

Google prepared this report to help you and public health officials understand responses to social
distancing guidance related to COVID-19. This report shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic,
prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel
plans.

Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we
don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with
different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).

We’ll leave a region out of the report if we don’t have statistically significant levels of data. To learn how
we calculate these trends and preserve privacy, read About this data.
